# property-registration
The government can utilise the feature set of a blockchain to reduce the difficulties faced in the traditional property registration process. A distributed ledger can be set up among the buyer, seller, bank, registration authority and notary. Property details can be stored in the blockchain and accessed from it, and these details are immutable, meaning they cannot be altered by anybody.
